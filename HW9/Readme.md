This homework assignment was about using several different tree models to analyize Higgs boson data. First, 2 classifier tree models were trained and tested on the Higgs data. These were a Random Forest Classifier and a Gradient Boosted Tree Classifier, and they were compared by plotting the confusion matrices for both models. Then, 2 regression models were also trained and tested on the Higgs data. These were a Random Forest Regressor and a Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor, and they were compared by examining how they minimized the L2 and L1 loss functions. Lastly, the four most important features in the Random Forest Classifier were found and plotted.

For this homework, I got some help from Masooma and Bivek. I chatted with Masooma about data cleaning, and they helped me realize that I needed to remove the -999 values from the dataset. I talked with Bivek about the regressor models to make sure I was using the right data when creating the training and testing subsets. I had also sent a couple messages in the slack about the regressor models, as I was getting seemingly low scores and really bad overfitting. Shar, Fed, and Rayta all tried to help me over slack.


I made use of the shared Titantic notebook for reading in the Kaggle data and for the feature importance code.
