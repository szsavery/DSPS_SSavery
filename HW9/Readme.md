This homework assignment was about using several different tree models to analyize Higgs boson data. First, 2 classifier tree models were trained and tested on the Higgs data. These were a Random Forest Classifier and a Gradient Boosted Tree Classifier, and they were compared by plotting the confusion matrices for both models. Then, 2 regression models were also trained and tested on the Higgs data. These were a Random Forest Regressor and a Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor, and they were compared by examining how they minimized the L2 and L1 loss functions. Lastly, the four most important features in the Random Forest Classifier were found and plotted.
