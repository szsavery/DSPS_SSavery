This homework assignment was about using several different tree models to analyize Higgs boson data. First, 2 classifier tree models were trained and tested on the Higgs data. These were a Random Forest Classifier and a Gradient Boosted Tree Classifier, and they were compared by plotting the confusion matrices for both models. Then, 2 regression models were also trained and tested on the Higgs data. These were a Random Forest Regressor and a Gradient Boosted Tree Regressor, and they were compared
