During this homework, we had to try fitting several different kinds of models to how the magnitude of GRB afterglows change with log time. The first part of this homework had us redoing the sklearn model to find the best linear fit for this magnitude versus log time data. Next we had to use MCMC to find another set of best fit parameters for the linear fit of this data. After analyizing the MCMC linear fit, we then had to create broken power law as another potential model for this magnitude versus log time data. We also had to recreate the log probability/posterior and likelihood functions for the bpl model.
