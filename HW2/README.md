Homework assignment 2 was about getting familiarity with several of the most commonly used and seen distribution functions. In the first part of this assignment, I had to look at the Maxwell-Boltzman distribution, which applies statistics to a problem of describing macroscopic features through information known about its mircoscopic components. We compared distributions created with a random assortment of values that fit the Maxwell-Boltzman to the expected values of those distributions based on the mathematical equations that described the distributions. We looked at the expected and empirical mean, as well as how the mode of the random distributions compared to these means. In the second half the assignment, we had to exmaine 5 different statsitical distributions. This was done by creating 100 randomly sized samples, which then had their means compared to that of the entire population's. The goal was to show that for all of the distributions, the law of large numbers is followed as sample size is increased. Lastly, a Gaussian was fit to the means of the histograms for the means of all the distributions.
