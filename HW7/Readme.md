For this homework, we are applying several different clustering methods on microarray gene data from patients with renal cell cancer. The cluster methods tested using this data are the KMeans test, DBScan, and Agglomerative clustering. In order to help visualize this dataset, UMAP and t-SNE were used to create 2D projections of the data. These would then be plotted with the different cluster labels found by the tests, in order to show the clusters in 2D space. Lastly, the dendrogram visualization method was used with the Agglomerative clustering method.

On this homework I worked with Bivek, Masooma, Sarah, and Paula. Bivek helped me with writing the calIVCar function as well as using it with the KMeans test to find the optimal number of clusters. I worked with Masooma, Sarah, and Paula while running through plotting the t-SNE and UMAP projections with the cluster labels from the 3 methods of clustering. They also helped me with any questions I had with trying to implement the DBScan and Agglomerative clustering methods, as well as suggesting ways to visualize the Euclidean distances for the dataset.
