Both of these figures are plotting the parent periods found in lightcurve data of the white dwarf G29-38. They are plotting amplitude versus period with the point's color signifying the year that the observation was made. The goal of this plot is to find the mean period spacing for G29-38, as this allows us to better understand it's likely composition and to narrow down other characteristics of the white dwarf.

The changes that I have made were plotting the amplitude on a log scale and to remove the grey bars that was marking the points' positions along the period axis. I choose to switch to a log scale due to how the majority of the amplitudes are below 20, so in the original linear scale the few outliers with extremely large amplitudes caused the rest to be bunched up. This new log scaled version is able to show the separation between points is this actually present, but was hidden by the linear scaling. The plot is able to show off how much of the amplitude-period parameter space was actual reached by G29-38 during these 50 years of observation. I removed the grey bars after making the switch to the log amplitude scale, as they just cluttered the figure without adding anything to it. One other change I looked at making was using a different colorbar as I was worried about the light orange and pink data points getting mixed up. However, after going many of the other colormaps in python, I couldn't find one that was definitively better so I left the colorbar unchanged.
