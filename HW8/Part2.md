Both of these figures are plotting the parent periods found in lightcurve data of the white dwarf G29-38. They are plotting amplitude versus period with the point's color signifying the year that the observation was made. The goal of this plot is to find the mean period spacing for G29-38, as this allows us to better understand it's likely composition and to narrow down other characteristics of the white dwarf.
