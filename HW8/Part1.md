I decided to choose both of these figures from "Constraining stellar and orbital co-evolution through ensemble seismology of solar-like oscillators in binary systems" by P.G. Beck et al. The top figure plots the orbital periods and eccentricities of binary systems with known evolutionary stages on the primary. The color of the point is tied to its evolutionary stage and the shape is due to which mission observed the star.
