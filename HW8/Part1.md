I decided to choose both of these figures from "Constraining stellar and orbital co-evolution through ensemble seismology of solar-like oscillators in binary systems" by P.G. Beck et al. The top figure plots the orbital periods and eccentricities of binary systems with known evolutionary stages on the primary. The color of each point is tied to its evolutionary stage and the shape is due to which mission observed the star. On the plot background, the blue arcs show lines of constant angular momentum at several different orbital periods and the background color shows the probability-density distribution of the full sample. The second figure is two histograms showing the number of systems with a specific eccentricity and orbital period respectively. I wanted to show off both figures due to the consistancy in color selection across them, allowing for easy readability between them. Plus I really liked how the histogram was layered to improve readability. Out of Tufte's rules, these plots respect data/ink >> 1, no chart junk, and avoiding redundancy in communication. The authors found a way to cleanly plot their 4 different variables through the use of distinctive colors and shapes for the points while also not clutering up the graph to do so.

The bad plot I have chosen is from "First Extragalactic Detection of Thermal Hydroxyl (OH) 18cm Emission in M31 Reveals Abundant CO-faint Molecular Gas" by Michael P. Busch.
