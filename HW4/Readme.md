In part 1 of this homework, we explored how the actual velocity versus radius curves for both Andromeda and the Milky Way behave versus expectations, assuming no dark matter. Exploring this data should highlight to us the need for dark matter to explain what is seen in these velocity curves. In the second part of this homework we are running a MCMC sampler for over 10^4 counts and then comparing that to the expected Gaussian output.

In the first part of this homework, I worked with several people and helped others with their questions. I worked with Tali and Shar until we reached the vratios function. The next day, Tali and I hashed out what we thought the vratios function code should be because we were both having trouble understanding what was wanted. I helped Masooma, Sarah, Paula, Bivek, Shreya, and Miles with some questions they had as they went through this problem.

In the second part of this homework I got help from Tali and Masooma. Masooma was super helpful in explaining how to create the MCMC sampler, as I was having trouble parsing that section of the paper. Tali helped me with the code for creating the expected gaussian fit line as well as normalizing the MCMC histogram data. I was then able to figure out the normalized histogram using the plt.stairs() function. I also chatted with Bivek in general about how we were both going through the process of solving this question.
