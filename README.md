# DSPS_SSavery
Repository for DSPS 2023 class, Physics 661

What is the reason why you decided to take the class?
The reason I decided to take this class is that I believe it well help me develop the skills to deal with large amounts of data. These are skills that I will really need, since I'm planning to do time-based astronomy for my research which will require having to deal with lots of data from many different datasets. 

What do you hope to learn the most?
The thing I'm hoping to learn the most would be how to make use of a wider range of python elements in my research coding. I have some experience with using things like dictionaries from previous coding classes, but in my actual research coding I have ended up mainly used lists, loops, and arrays. I hope this class will spark ideas for how I can make use of dictionaries, functions, etc. in my research.

What are the strengths in your background or character that you think will help you in the class?
I think my strength that will help the most for this class is time management. At least when dealing with projects and papers, I have found the need to at least start them pretty early in order to help my nerves. Like I may not be doing a ton, but I try to do at least some bits and pieces well in advance of the due date.
